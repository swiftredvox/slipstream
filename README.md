# Slipstream

[![Launch Slipstream](https://img.shields.io/badge/Launch-Slipstream-6ee7ff?style=for-the-badge)](https://swiftredvox.github.io/slipstream/Slipstream_V40.html)

Slipstream is an interactive, browser-based ink simulation you can run entirely offline from a single HTML file.  
Paint swirling, turbulent ink with your mouse, experiment with colour palettes and simulation settings, or switch on hypnotic automated visualisers that generate endless flowing patterns. Designed to be both creative and meditative, Slipstream works equally well for a few minutes of play or as a mesmerising full-screen display.
